function h = figcopy(fc,fm)
% FIGCOPY - copies one figure into another figure and lets the
% users move and  resize the copied figure. This utility is great
% if you need a figure in a figure and still would like to use
% MATLAB's export function.
%
% h = FIGCOPY the user selects both figures by mouse clicks. Please
% follow the instructions in the command window. First activate the
% figure to be copied. Second activate the "master" figure and
% select the lower left and upper right corner, where the copied
% figure should appear in the "master" figure. Click on the copied
% figure to move or resize it. (Don't worry, the resize markers
% will not be printed!) h is the handle of the copied figure.
%
% h = FIGCOPY(fc) fc specifies the figure number (handle) to be
% copied. The master figure is selected by mouse click. 
%
% h = FIGCOPY(fc,fm) specifies the figure number to be copied and
% the figure number of the master figure.
