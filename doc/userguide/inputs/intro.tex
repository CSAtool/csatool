\section{Introduction}
CSAtool is a MATLAB GUI simulation and modeling environment created for both the analysis and the assisted design of the capacitive DACs of charge-redistribution successive approximation analog-to-digital converters (CR SAR ADCs) in integrated-circuit technologies. In general, this tool allows to estimate both the static and the dynamic performance of such ADCs independently of the chosen technology.
This is possible simply providing models that allow the users to size the DAC array capacitive elements with an high degree of customization.
Moreover, the tool deals also with a variety of technological parameters which can be customized by the user to fit a particular technology performance.
By choosing a specific DAC topology defined by the combination of a capacitive network and a switching algorithm, sizing the capacitive array and setting the technology parameters, the effects of both intrinsic parasitic capacitances and capacitor mismatch on the ADC performance can be estimated.
In addition, with the aid of specific modules provided by the tool, also the impact  of the parasitic related to each critical array node and/or capacitor (for example the parasitic values coming from a post-layout c-extraction) can be analyzed. 
Finally, thanks to its simulation speed, which is up to a factor $10^5$ faster than those achievable with the most common EDA tools based testbenches, CSAtool offers the chance to perform statistical and montecarlo simulations over a desired number of realizations in a reasonable amount of time.
